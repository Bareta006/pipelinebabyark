If the seat moves less than an inch in any direction, it is securely installed.<br/>If the car seat moves more than an inch, try a different seat in your vehicle.<br/>If you are concerned about the movement of your car seat, please contact babyark and one of our experts will work with you to make sure your car seat is installed correctly.</p>"
